Project Focus:

JS Extension that allows people to open groove pizza, use it, and then import sound. (scratch 2.0) *Launch groove pizza button*

Accordion Extension: Block - When sprite is clicked it asks for name to make it dance. Each letter is a different note. We would use the spotify extension toooo……


Resource Launch URL Extension

Panning block



Next Step:  Create a block that launches a website (scratch x)


***Text To Song** - Name playing with music notes:
Make block: Asks for name. Each letter will output respective note based on tone.js.
Create our won block that plays sound for each letter tone.js (like talking gobo) https://github.com/sayamindu/scratch-extensions
