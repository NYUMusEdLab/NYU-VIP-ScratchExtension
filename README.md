Prototype Scratch Music Blocks

Project Focus:

Goals:

1. More sounds: Load Sound-font library & play notes
	Global Variables: Root, Tempo, Mode/Scale, Instrument (local to Sprite)
	Chunk instruments into families (e.g. woodwinds, brass, etc.).
2. Open GroovePizza as a block (lauching external URLs)
3. play sequences of sound (pitches/rhythms)
4. Josh's audio blocks: delay, reverb, filters, 
5. Sampler audio record and playback


Audiences:

1. Kids as exploration
2. Kids with parent/teacher support
3. For teachers


For Kids:

Pitches: letter names, 
	C4
	60
	1, 2, 3, 4, -1, -5, -5, -4, 



JS Extension that allows people to open groove pizza, use it, and then import sound. (scratch 2.0) *Launch groove pizza button*

Accordion Extension: Block - When sprite is clicked it asks for name to make it dance. Each letter is a different note. We would use the spotify extension toooo……


Resource Launch URL Extension
Import a pack of how to with resource block
Panning block



Next Step:  Create a block that launches a website (scratch x)


***Text To Song** - Name playing with music notes:
Make block: Asks for name. Each letter will output respective note based on tone.js.
Create our won block that plays sound for each letter tone.js (like talking gobo) https://github.com/sayamindu/scratch-extensions
